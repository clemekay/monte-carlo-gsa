  abstract  = "Advances in computing hardware and algorithms have dramatically improved the ability to simulate complex processes computationally. Today's simulation capabilities offer the prospect of addressing questions that in the past could be addressed only  by resource-intensive experimentation, if at all. Assessing the Reliability of Complex Models recognizes the ubiquity of uncertainty in computational estimates of reality and the necessity for its quantification.\nAs computational science and engineering have matured, the process of quantifying or bounding uncertainties in a computational estimate of a physical quality of interest has evolved into a small set of interdependent tasks: verification, validation, and uncertainty of quantification (VVUQ). In recognition of the increasing importance of computational simulation and the increasing need to assess uncertainties in computational results, the National Research Council was asked to study the mathematical foundations of VVUQ and to recommend steps that will ultimately lead to improved processes.\nAssessing the Reliability of Complex Models discusses changes in education of professionals and dissemination of information that should enhance the ability of future VVUQ practitioners to improve and properly apply VVUQ methodologies to difficult problems, enhance the ability of VVUQ customers to understand VVUQ results and use them to make informed decisions, and enhance the ability of all VVUQ stakeholders to communicate with each other. This report is an essential resource for all decision and policy makers in the field, students, stakeholders, UQ experts, and VVUQ educators and practitioners.",

% Introduce fast-TMC and compare to fast GRS and TMC (total monte carlo)
% Fast TMC is, algorithmically, similar to what we're doing. Instead of over-resolving the MC RT each time, change the random number seed between different MC RT runs so you can estimate the MC RT uncertainty.
% For the k-code mode, "the correlation of fission cycles can introduce significant negative bias into the estimation of the k-eff statistical uncertainty."
% The fast GRS method seems maybe similar to the Saltelli method but the random seed is manipulated as a parameter to quantify the effect of the random seeding on the output variance.
